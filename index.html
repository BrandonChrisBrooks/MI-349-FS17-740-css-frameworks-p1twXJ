        <h2>How does this work?</h2>

        <p>
          We cater to your needs as a bussiness. Meaning, we aim to design your dream website (within reason).
          Before we begin to build your website, we get together in one or more meetings and decide various
          things like scope of the project and the quality that is expected as well as the desired design.
          We then give you various estimates like the cost of building your website and the time it will take
          to complete your website. If you don't like it, that's okay. You're not locked in until after you
          decide we will be the ones to build your website.
        </p>

        <h2>Can we get some examples?</h2>

        <p>
          Sure thing! There are examples of previous projects all over the website. On this page, you can see
          project designs we are currently working on. If you see the code available on this page and start freaking
          out about privacy of your website, no worries, that's just a sample. It was used for a project that
          has long since been discontinued. If you want to view previous projects, look at the navigation bar above!
        </p>

        <h2>This is cool, but how much does it cost?</h2>

        <p>
          ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's really hard to say. Pricing depends on various things like the scope of the project, quality
          expected, rate of getting things approved, and timer given to complete the website. But, there's no need
          to worry about us changing the price. The price will stay the same within reason. If you want us to
          add an entirely need capability, that won't only change the time but other factors as well. This would
          also have an effect on the pricing.
